    <h2 class="section_divider">Accomodation</h2>
    <p class="section_divider">At Manhcester University, there are many accomodation options
      throughout the campus and convenient methods of transportation to and from where you reside
      and the campus.
    </p>
    <p class="section_divider">Unless you plan on living at home during your studies, your main options are private
      student accomodation or student halls accomodation. If you choose to stay in halls there 
      are three campuses to choose from, Fallowfield, Victoria Park and City Campus.
      Each of these campuses have their own pros and cons.
    </p>

    <div class="accomodation">
      <div class="fallow">
        <a href="https://www.accommodation.manchester.ac.uk/ouraccommodation/hallsofresidence/fallowfield/" target="_blank"><img src="images/fallow_exterior.jpg" alt="image of fallowfield campus" class="image"></a>
        <h3>Fallowfield Campus</h3>
        <p> Fallowfield campus, which has the reputation of the most sociable campus, with flat parties being thrown day and night. It may be far from university campus but it is a convenient location for shopping, with good bus links to make up for its distance from the university. A bus pass may be a necessary investment if you live in Fallowfield.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="victoria">
       <a href="https://www.accommodation.manchester.ac.uk/ouraccommodation/hallsofresidence/victoriapark/" target="_blank"><img src="images/victoria_park_acc.jpg" alt="image of victoria park campus" class="image"></a>
        <h3>Victoria Park</h3>
        <p>Next there is Victoria Park, a quieter campus within walking distance to the classes on main campus and an on-site bar with nice vibes and nicer prices. This campus may be less convenient when it comes to its proximity to stores, which it makes up for with its proximity to parks and coffee shops, and of course, the university itself.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="city">
        <a href="https://www.accommodation.manchester.ac.uk/ouraccommodation/hallsofresidence/city/" target="_blank"><img src="images/city_campus.jpg" alt="image of city campus" class="image"></a>
        <h3>City Campus</h3>
        <p> City campus can be divided into two sections, one on Oxford Road and one less than 5 minutes from North Campus itself. Both are very conveniently located but the one on North campus is perfect if your one to roll out of bed 5 minutes before you have to be in class. It also happens to be 5 minutes away from the best clubs in manchester, as well as a 24/7 convenience store.

    <h2 class="section_divider">Activities on Campus</h2>
    <p class="section_divider"> From voluneteering to Manchester's clubbing scene, there are a number of ways to get involved in social activities during your course.
      We have a large variety of societies available at the Uni. Some of the societies such as boxing and football are offered for competing athletes and a professional website.
      Furthermore, there are student run societies such as chess boxing, wine tasting and international societies. There is something for everyone!</p>
     <p class="section_divider"> Many volunteering opportunities are offered too. From volunteering to clean up homeless shelters to youth mental health mentoring to fundraisering volunteers, 
      there is more than enough variety to interest you should you be looking for volunteer work.</p>
      <p class="section_divider"> There is also a Peer-Buddy scheme for students studying at Manchester University. 
      This scheme is for students who are based off-campus, isolating or just in need of a friend at Uni.</p>
